## Git Workflow for Version Control
We use a feature-branch workflow to keep our `main` branch stable and production-ready.

### Branches:
*   **`main`**: Production code. Only stable releases go here.
*   **`develop`**: Integration branch. All new feature branches merge into here first.
*   **`feature/*`**: For new features (e.g., `feature/contact-page`).

### How to Contribute:
1.  Checkout `develop`: `git checkout develop`
2.  Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3.  Make changes and commit.
4.  Merge back into `develop` when ready.
